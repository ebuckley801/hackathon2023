# hackathon2023
The website was created with the intent to be used alongside our .py file. 
We intended for the users to be able to input an image, which would then 
result in our machine-learning algorithm outputting whether the image 
contains a pineapple or not. We succsessfully created a neural network to
identify certain objects, but could not fully implement the  python scripts 
on the website in time for the end of the hackathon, but intend to finish 
and clean everything up in the future.
