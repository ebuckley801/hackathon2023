Welcome to our program!

We created a neural network to identify the main subject of a picture. We trained it using the CIFAR 10 dataset. 

Our program is capable of identifying ten distinct objects: an airplane, a car, a bird, a cat, a deer, a dog, a frog, a horse, a ship, and a truck.

For your convenience we included ten pictures in this program's directory, each one corresponding to one of the items listed above. To test our program, you can enter any one of those files when prompted to input a file name. I.e. if you type "horse.jpg" under the prompt, our program will process the picture of a horse that is included in the same directory.

If you wish to submit your own picture, follow the instructions below:
1) Find a picture of one of the ten objects in our dataset;
2) Use https://safeimagekit.com/resize-image-to-32x32 to resize that image to 32x32 bits;
3) Move the 32x32 bits picture to the same directory as our program;\
4) When prompted for a a file name, enter the name of the picture you chose.

At its core, our program is a pineapple detection solution. We will not further elaborate.

Thank you for using our program - we will return next year!
